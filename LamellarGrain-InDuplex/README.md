#### Background
DREAM3D is an open source software, it is an architecture for computational 
microstructure modeling. The software can be used specially for polycrystalline
microstructure generation, processing, characterization manipulation, and many more.
One of the special capabilites of this software is to generate statistically 
equivalent RVE of material-microstructure. However, if there are multiphases 
in a single grains  or any other complexity exists in a grain, that is not 
covered. For example, if the microstructure has lamellar grains, or, grains 
with twin regions, or any other intra-grain complexity then this software cannot 
offer such functionalities. 

#### Objective:
Lets say, We would like introduce statistically equivalent microtructure  even 
inside each grain. For example, duplex, fullylamellar, or grains with twins, etc.
To achieve this we need an efficient algorithm that is to be implemented as 
a filter of DREAM3D. 

An attempt to achieve duplex or fully lamellar RVE:
The class or filter (GenerateLamellaeAlongXYZPlanes) is an attempt to generate 
duplex or fully lamellar microstructures. To make statistically equivalnet,
there are many tasks to be done. This filter is the first step to this total work. 
Approximately 70 different directional lamellar can be generated according
to the developed algorithm. This filter inclused only 10 directional lamellae so far. 
Rest are to be included one by one.

#### How to use:
To use this filter, firstly, DREAM3D developer version will have to be installed. 
Then this filter will have to be put into the proper group. Corresponsing 
documentatioan file will have to be updated and linked. Finally, the complete 
DREAM3D project will have be compiled/built. Once successful build is done, 
this filter will appear in the user interface of DREAM3D. So the filter can be
used in any intended pipeline of DREAM3D. 


#### Results:
An example output is shown with two images. TiAl alloy microstructure (1000 grains) 
without lamellae (figure-1), generated by DREAM3D will be used as input 
for this filter. After executing the filter, particular type of grains will have
lamellar structures, as shown in the second figure.
